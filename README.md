# Steps to run the application:

First step is to add the environment variables into the project.
This is normally something I wouldn't do, I would have to create a Vault in Onepassword send you an invite but since its just a demo application I feel comfortable skipping those steps and adding the information here:

Create a .env file in the root folder of the project and paste this

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:9001

## Install the dependencies

### `npm install once you have selected the root folder in your IDE`

### Run the application

Execute npm start in the terminal and you're all setup to test the application if you have already running the backend with docker :)
